[{"category":"Separation anxiety","desc":"One of the most common complaints of pet parents is that their dogs are disruptive or destructive when left alone. Their dogs might urinate, defecate, bark, howl, chew, dig or try to escape. Although these problems often indicate that a dog needs to be taught polite house manners, they can also be symptoms of distress."},
{"category":"Barking","desc":"Barking is one of many forms of vocal communication for dogs. People are often pleased that their dog barks, because it alerts them to the approach of people to their home or it tells them there’s something that the dog wants or needs. However, sometimes a dog’s barking can be excessive. Because barking serves a variety of functions, you must identify its cause and your dog’s motivation for barking before you can treat a barking problem."},
{"category":"Destructive Chewing","desc":"It\\'s normal for puppies and dogs to chew on objects as they explore the world. Chewing accomplishes a number of things for a dog.
